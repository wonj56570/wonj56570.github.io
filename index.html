<h2>Bio:</h2>

<h2><p>As you have read from above my name is Tiffany Wong but my full name is Joie Tiffany C. Wong. I have only been to two different shoals Quezon City Christian Academy (QCCA) witch is in Manila Philippines. And this one Hangzhou International School (HIS). My favorite thing to learn in school is Science. The biggest challenge I have had as a student is moving school especially if the school is in a different country. There has never been a teacher to influence me before because every teacher has their ups and downs and I just have not found/met a teacher that has only ups. By the end of the school year I would like to have enough knowledge to be able to make a simple website that I can use to make my cousins jealous.</p></h2>
